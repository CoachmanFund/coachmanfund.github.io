# Who am I?

I am currently a master candidate in Mathematics in Finance at Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University, with experience from several quantitative internships as a quantitative analyst in different buy-side companies. I have a great intuition of applying advanced modelling skills and coding techniques into the quantitative trading scenario. 

#### Education Background

* Master of Science, Mathematics in Finance ([Courant](https://math.nyu.edu/financial_mathematics/)), New York University, New York
* Bachelor of Economics, Honorable Finance ([Antai College of Economics & Management](http://www.acem.sjtu.edu.cn/)), Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai
* High School, Physics Olympiad ,[Chongqing Bashu Middle School](http://www.bashu.cn/), Chongqing

#### Working Experience

Internship:

* Macro Quantitative Analyst Summer Intern, Balyasny Asset Management, [BAM](https://www.bamfunds.com/), (June 2020 – August 2020)
* Quantitative Analyst Fulltime Intern, Shanxi Securities, [山西证券](http://www.sxzq.com/shouye/index.shtml), (July 2018 – July 2019)

    • IDE and tools: Spyder, WingIDE, Eclipse, CodeBlocks, Jupyter Notebook, Eviews, Visual Studio
    • Database: MongoDb, SQL, HDF5
    • Language: English (Fluent), Chinese (Native)

#### Some Highlights

* Academic Credentials – For undergraduate study, I ranked top 5% in Shanghai Jiao Tong University with a GPA 3.9, and received the National scholarship and Guanghua scholarship. I chose coursework to fuel my investment and quantitative career, and I kept a straight-A record for my mathematics courses and had finished wide range of programming courses. Hence, I was admitted to M.S. of Mathematics and could keep exploring rigorous course at Courant.  
* Relevant Internship Experience – I had five periods of internship during my undergraduate years for total 22 months. I used to work for a CTA hedge fund, a high-frequency trading firm, a mutual fund, and a proprietary trading team in a listed security firm, following an advancement in Machine Learning and other techniques. Therefore, I mastered competitive quantitative skills and gained rich experience in developing data management solution, trading strategies and trading systems. 
* Strong and Comprehensive Coding Skills – With regard to modelling language, I have rich coding experience in Python and R. For Python, I have programmed an automatic trading platform and research platform for quantitative trading strategies. This platform was once used for my real time trading and investment. For hardcore language, I learnt rigorous C++ course and now Java is required for our courses at Courant. C++ plays an important role in the CTP API construction of my trading system and now I am developing trading system in Java to reach a faster speed.
* Market Intuition and Trading Experience – Personally, I used to trade in stocks and futures in the markets of China and US for nearly 4 years. Also, gold and crude oil are traded for hedging purpose. Proprietary trading made me build my own trading framework and principle, and it also helped me improve my market intuition.
